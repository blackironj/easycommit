# easycommit

easycommit is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of writing Git commit messages. It uses an [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) as backend.

ðŸš§ I'm currently trying to find appropriate and accurate prompts. and I think `Mistral` is the best fit on my CLI now.
